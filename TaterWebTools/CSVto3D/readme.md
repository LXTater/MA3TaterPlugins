This is known working on MA3 v2.2.5.2. However, this should work on any version that allows the syntax "Set Fixture X Property "Pos/RotXYZ" "Y".

Save your showfile as a different name BEFORE YOU RUN THE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED PLUGIN!!! I can't help if something breaks n you lose stuff.

Working CSV version is available at:

The .mvr version does not work yet, and might not even be created. This whole thing may have been a waste of time, but it worked to help me out lol.
