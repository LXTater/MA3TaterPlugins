-- Plugin Version: 1.0 and early version  of 2.0
-- Please send any bugs to Tater@LXTater.com
-- Updated 4/6/2025
-- Verified working for MA3 V 2.2.5.2 (only the v1.0 of the plugin)
-- this will most likely break your showfile... PLease don't use this unnless you know what ur doing lol!!!!
-- v2 is on the way that is going to automatically generate sequences and recipes for you depending on your settings
-- this will allow you to turn an entire fader page editable with the my version of the LOS System.
-- Comments are terrible rn sorry

Going to try and make this into something that can be pulled up on any console, but as of right now this is stricly tied to a personal showfile.
