This is an unfished version for the setlist manager.

Currently working on the problem solving for songs that 1) do not have a nextsong cue that is findable, and 2) handles if the song is the last song in the setlist.

Currently the automatic parsing functions work, I just run into issues when a sequence does not already have a next song cue. 

Please don't use this if you don't know what you're doing, like I said- this is unfinished and not stable <3.
